Jeff started his journey in the tech industry back in 1997 when he founded his own website development company, which was one of the pioneering companies in the country at the time. While working in technology, Jeff's comedic talents couldn't be contained, and he eventually took to the stage as a stand-up comedian.

Jeff's passion for comedy led him to create Hashtag Roundup (@hashtagroundup), a platform that contributed over 8000 top 10 USA trends on Twitter. With the growth of social media, particularly Instagram, Jeff founded Stampede Social, a company aimed at helping creators drive traffic to their content without relying solely on a link in their bio.

Marrying technology with business objectives has become Jeff's expertise, and lives to share knowledge and experiences with others.",,https://stampede.social,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffdwoskin,,,https://instagram.com/stampede_social,https://x.com/bigmacher,https://www.facebook.com/StampedeSocial/,,All Access,Network/SaaS,B2B,2 to 4,Yes,To raise awareness of your brand / product / service,"Agency,Content Creation,Creator/Influencer Marketplace,Demand Generation,Influencer Platform","Automotive,Beauty & Personal Care,Clothing / Shoes / Accessories,Coaching / Consulting,Ecommerce,Entertainment,Food & Beverage,Health & Wellness"

Alexander,Jacquet,https://cdn-api.swapcard.com/public/images/94105df983ba4e13b92ac0227ee2f634.jpeg,CEO,Trusting Pixels Inc.,"Is your brand partnering with authentic influencers? Is your content strategy aligned with European advertising laws? 

At Trusting Pixels, we specialize in helping brands and agencies navigate these challenges. Our technology allows brands and agencies to detect retouching edits on influencer content. 
 
Why is this important? Our software allows brands and agencies to analyze influencer content for retouching edits before commencing partnerships. This data allows brands to find authentic influencers who deliver trustworthy content and truly value authenticity. 
 
Vetting for authentic influencers will also help brands stay compliant with France and Norway’s new retouching laws. Our software can be utilized as a tool to not only audit influencers before engaging in partnerships, but also to audit their paid content once its published in order to protect brands from fines and penalties due to non-compliance.  
 
If authenticity and compliance are priorities for your brand, let’s connect to explore how Trusting Pixels can elevate your influencer partnerships. 

About Alexander:

Alexander brings a unique perspective to the fight for authenticity. With a background in the Visual Effects industry, he has contributed to creating photo-realistic computer-generated imagery for films such as Godzilla, Ford v Ferrari, and Game of Thrones, as well as commercials for brands like Adidas, Revlon, and Apple.

His expertise in crafting photorealistic computer generated content positioned him to create software that can detect this type of fake content. Together with a team of data scientists, Alexander has developed proprietary machine learning models capable of identifying retouching edits on humans.

Alexander’s commitment to authenticity extends to regulatory compliance. Following the debut retouching laws in France, he had the honor of meeting with President Macron and the DGCCRF to discuss the market's response to this legislation. He has also engaged in conversations with the Norwegian Consumer Authority (NCA), demonstrating Trusting Pixels’ deep understanding of compliance requirements in France and Norway's retouching laws.

Feel free to connect with Alexander during the conference to discuss these critical compliance matters and how Trusting Pixels can support your brand’s authenticity goals.",,https://www.trustingpixels.com/,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjacquet/,,,,,,,All Access,Network/SaaS,B2B,2 to 4,No,To network,"AI (Artificial Intelligence),Reporting & Insights",Computer / Telecom / Electronics

I am seeking to collaborate with influencers to diversify the company’s collectible gift card catalog, as well as to co-create (as partners) around the game-changing gift card/product pairs we’re bringing to market.
